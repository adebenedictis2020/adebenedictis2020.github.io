By offering hybrid courses, training, guidance, and strategic support, Coursemojo empowers districts to create sustainable, high-quality education models for the future.




Note: While we do not have any known math (Algebra 1, Algebra 2 and/or Geometry) openings right now, you may express interest in our part-time (1099 contract) math teacher position should our needs change and if you would like to be considered.




Why is this role important?




Our online teachers deliver and teach high-quality courses to our district and school partners.

They prepare and lead lessons, and they regularly collaborate with in-person “learning coaches” at our partner schools to provide a hybrid experience where students learn a lot and love their experience.




This is a part-time (1099 contract) role for the 2023-24 school year, teaching up to four sections of Algebra 1, Algebra 2 and/or Geometry. In a typical week for one section, online teachers can anticipate their core work as teaching (about 5 hours) and planning/grading (about 2 hours). Online teachers also engage in coaching, professional development, and recurring team meetings (typically one hour on average per week, though varies week-to-week).




The ideal candidate is passionate about delivering inspiring and meaningful learning experiences to students through technology and has experience teaching in a virtual or hybrid environment.

 * Respond to messages from students, caregivers, and administration within 48 hours (communication via student managing platform)
 * Provide additional support to students struggling with the academic expectations
 * Communicate and collaborate weekly with the school’s in-person “learning coach” who oversees the physical classroom and supports student attendance, participation, and assignment completion
 * Engage in regular feedback and coaching cycles with the Senior Director of Math
 * Participate in professional development (typically 5-8 hours a month)
 * Collaborate with Coursemojo’s Learning team on curriculum design and the broader team to provide feedback on what’s working and what could be improved
 * Contribute where needed as an integral member of an early-stage startup




What are we looking for?




Requirements




 * Direct experience teaching students Algebra 1, Algebra 2 and/or Geometry in grades 8-12
 * A track record of teaching and facilitating engaging and high-quality learning experiences for secondary students in the content area
 * Experience instilling students with a sense of ownership over their learning
 * Experience finding innovative ways to address unexpected challenges
 * Experience providing outcomes-based actionable feedback that helps students improve their engagement, learning and motivation
 * Familiarity with accessibility standards and how to design inclusive learning experiences for all learners

This is a part-time (1099 contract), fully remote position for candidates based in the United States for the 2023-24 school year.




What is the compensation for this position?




The part-time rate is determined by the number of sections you are interested in teaching that aligns with your availability. The rate for each section is $14,000.




Our Commitment




Studies have shown that people of color and women are less likely to apply for jobs unless they believe they check all the boxes listed in a job description. We encourage you to apply, even if you don't believe you meet every one of our qualifications described.




We are committed to recruiting, hiring, and retaining a diverse team.

Avenues Online

Available anywhere in the world with a wifi connection, Avenues Online was intentionally designed to foster deep, innovative learning with maximum flexibility. With its interdisciplinary, project-based curriculum especially written for both synchronous and asynchronous learning, its own proprietary learning platform, and an outstanding, collaborative global faculty, Avenues Online is establishing a new standard in online education. Our students reside in over 30 countries and bring their diverse cultural and geographic context and global mobility to their learning each day.

About The Role

Math teachers at Avenues ensure that students act as mathematicians every day. In grades 5-12, Avenues embraces a problem-based mathematics pedagogy and curriculum. Students complete a weekly math notebook through which they attempt solutions, ask questions, receive feedback, iterate, and reflect on mistakes to master mathematical concepts gradually.

About The Springfield Empowerment Zone Partnership

While Massachusetts is consistently ranked as one of the top states for education results in the country, we have one of the highest and most persistent opportunity gaps. The Springfield Empowerment Zone Partnership (SEZP) - established in 2015 as a collaboration between Springfield Public Schools (SPS), the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE), and the Springfield Education Association (SEA) - seeks to improve the longitudinal life outcomes of the nearly 5,000 students in our seventeen middle and high schools.

As a ""zone"" of schools within the city of Springfield, SEZP's approach draws on a deep and embedded partnership with the school district and local teachers' union, while harnessing the flexibility and innovation found in autonomous school models. As a result, each school within SEZP is accorded significant school-based autonomies - in curriculum, talent, calendar, schedule, and budget - while being held accountable for realizing achievement gains for historically marginalized students. In all of our work, SEZP is in pursuit of equity and anti-racism - acknowledging the systemic oppression our students and families encounter daily and working to disrupt these provision gaps urgently and courageously.

At Brooklyn Ascend High School (BAHS), we are looking for teachers who are passionate about their academic discipline and personally driven by the academic achievement of their students. Ascend teachers hold exceptionally high intellectual expectations of their students and create a culture of joyful academic discovery in their rooms. Their aim is to ignite intellectual curiosity in their students and build their academic knowledge and confidence in preparation for four-year colleges. They are vigilant in ensuring that all tasks placed before their students are rigorous and, without exception, reflect the school’s aspirations of academic excellence.

We are passionate about history teachers who are fired up about their lessons—who want to spend their time discussing, preparing, and immersing themselves in the rich content they teach. We value teachers who truly listen to what students are saying—who create a space for students to think their way through to answers, and who praise their insights and curiosities along the way. We value educators with a hunger for feedback and professional growth, and a dedication to excellence.

Our teachers know that a strong culture that respects and motivates students relies on excellent academic teaching in every room. We believe in restorative practices and teach students to resolve conflicts on their own, understand the impact of their actions, and acknowledge responsibility to the school community. We believe that a true liberal arts education – which fosters and prizes critical thinking and independence of thought—cannot be joined to a no-excuses culture that emphasizes silence and compliance. We prepare students for success in college and in life by fostering agency—our students’ confidence that they are in control of their own lives and can act of their own free choices.

At Brooklyn Ascend High School (BAHS), we are looking for teachers who are passionate about their academic discipline and personally driven by the academic achievement of their students. Ascend teachers hold exceptionally high intellectual expectations of their students and create a culture of joyful academic discovery in their rooms. Their aim is to ignite intellectual curiosity in their students and build their academic knowledge and confidence in preparation for four-year colleges. They are vigilant in ensuring that all tasks placed before their students are rigorous and, without exception, reflect the school’s aspirations of academic excellence.

We are passionate about history teachers who are fired up about their lessons—who want to spend their time discussing, preparing, and immersing themselves in the rich content they teach. We value teachers who truly listen to what students are saying—who create a space for students to think their way through to answers, and who praise their insights and curiosities along the way. We value educators with a hunger for feedback and professional growth, and a dedication to excellence.

Our teachers know that a strong culture that respects and motivates students relies on excellent academic teaching in every room. We believe in restorative practices and teach students to resolve conflicts on their own, understand the impact of their actions, and acknowledge responsibility to the school community. We believe that a true liberal arts education – which fosters and prizes critical thinking and independence of thought—cannot be joined to a no-excuses culture that emphasizes silence and compliance. We prepare students for success in college and in life by fostering agency—our students’ confidence that they are in control of their own lives and can act of their own free choices.

Position Summary

Blueprint Math Fellows are tutors charged with providing students with highly personalized tutoring in mathematics during the regular school day. Fellows work with 4 - 8 students at a time, delivering individualized lessons and working closely with teachers to accelerate students’ academic achievement. Fellows also work to build strong relationships with students to help increase their self-confidence and commitment to education. Our students see their Fellows as mentors, advocates and as passionate adults who make learning math understandable and fun.

While teachers have classrooms of 25 or 30 students, Fellows work with small groups of students. This allows for the individualization of remedial and supplemental instruction in a safe space, where students are encouraged to engage with one another and explain their thinking. Fellows individualize lessons to meet the needs, interests, and passions of their students and deliver data-driven instruction that not only significantly impacts student achievement, but inspires students to be lifelong learners. By using math as the vehicle, Fellows foster critical thinkers, confident communicators, and engaged citizens who question, reflect, self assess, visualize, respond positively to feedback, persevere, and internalize goal setting as a tool for continuous self-improvement.

Fellows receive curriculum materials, pre-service training, on-going mentoring and professional development as well as written evaluation of feedback from their assigned Site Manager. Fellows are charged with focusing on the individual needs of their students, helping to accelerate student achievement and close any skill gaps that may exist.

School in the Square (S2) is an independent, community-based charter school currently serving elementary and middle school students, with plans to one day serve families from Pre-K - 12th grade. Drawing its name from the concept of the public square or “la placita”, our mantra is “Relationships First”. S2 is where communities come together to solve problems and celebrate successes. S2 provides a progressive and rigorous learning community in which students thrive physically, emotionally, and academically through differentiated and personalized education and adults grow through rich and robust professional development. Our community is grounded in principles of justice, equity, diversity and inclusivity (JEDI), enacting a culturally responsive and sustaining lens to our pedagogical practice and consistently examining the ways we can continue to walk firmly in the pursuit of social justice and against injustice of any kind.

S2 engages, educates, and empowers its students to respond mindfully and creatively to life’s opportunities and challenges. We take seriously our obligation as an anchor institution in our community. We understand that our students’ ability to learn is directly impacted by their access to basic needs, which is why we established our Family Support Program. Through this program we support over 200 families every month at our bimonthly food pantries, in addition to providing other essential services, including internet hotspots and rent relief.

Our High School Community

In Fall 2024, School in the Square will open the doors of its new high school and welcome a founding class of more than 100 9th graders.


 * We believe in a “relationships first” approach to schooling—that social and emotional learning go hand-in-hand with academic learning, each supporting the other.
 * We hire smart people whose vision aligns with ours and empower them with the autonomy and resources to get the job done in the most creative, effective, and fulfilling way possible.
 * We measure learning with a holistic set of metrics - not limited to test scores— and design our learning environment around that principle.

Most critically, our faculty equip students with the knowledge and skills needed to experience secondary and postsecondary success, including the desire and capacity to learn independently, think critically, and communicate proficiently. Our Math Teachers have the privilege and responsibility of delivering on these outcomes as they advance students' knowledge and skills as burgeoning mathematicians.

Brief Overview of our School: Unity's Core Purpose is to provide all students with an exceptional educational experience that empowers them to lead fulfilling lives.

As a small, open-enrollment, community-based charter school that proudly serves the families of central Brooklyn in grades 6-12, a Unity education is best described as personalized, inclusive, well-rounded, and keenly focused on each child's long-term growth and development as skillful learners and whole-hearted human beings.

Given these qualities, Unity's most important resource as a school is the talent and dedication of our faculty and staff. At its core, a school is only as good as the learning experience of students over the course of each day. We invest significant time and resources to ensure that we, as a team, are providing all of our students with daily learning experiences that are healthy, safe, engaging, supportive, and appropriately challenging.

Most critically, our faculty equip students with the knowledge and skills needed to experience secondary and postsecondary success, including the desire and capacity to learn independently, think critically, and communicate proficiently. Our Math Teachers have the privilege and responsibility of delivering on these outcomes as they advance students' knowledge and skills as burgeoning mathematicians.

Brief Overview of our School: Unity's Core Purpose is to provide all students with an exceptional educational experience that empowers them to lead fulfilling lives.

As a small, open-enrollment, community-based charter school that proudly serves the families of central Brooklyn in grades 6-12, a Unity education is best described as personalized, inclusive, well-rounded, and keenly focused on each child's long-term growth and development as skillful learners and whole-hearted human beings.

Given these qualities, Unity's most important resource as a school is the talent and dedication of our faculty and staff. At its core, a school is only as good as the learning experience of students over the course of each day. We invest significant time and resources to ensure that we, as a team, are providing all of our students with daily learning experiences that are healthy, safe, engaging, supportive, and appropriately challenging.

We aim for each and every one of our students, upon graduating from Unity, to be empowered with the skills, knowledge, experiences, and disposition to succeed in their postsecondary endeavors, lead fulfilling lives, and positively impact their communities.

Our Recent Accomplishments: Regardless of where students are academically or otherwise as they enter our school, our focus is on accelerating growth and on cultivating long-term academic and non-academic success. This focus has reaped impressive results for our students and families in recent years. Among our accomplishments:


 * 94% of our first three graduating classes earned their high school diploma in four years.
 * 100% of our graduates had formal college and career plans with a college matriculation rate of 76%. This compares favorably to a 58% college matriculation rate for students in NYC.
 * 95% of our graduates complete at least one Advanced Placement (AP) course in high school. This compares favorably with the 33% of NYC graduates who enroll in AP courses during their high school tenure.
 * Our students who comprise subgroups that traditionally have been least effectively served by our education system, including students classified as economically disadvantaged, Black, Latino, and students with disabilities, have consistently outperformed their district and state peers in our high school graduation rates.
 * In holding true to our belief in providing a truly empowering education, a vast majority of our students experience the following over their seven years at Unity:
    * After-school extra-curricular activities, including athletics and clubs;
    * Formal community service initiatives;
    * End-of-year middle school Roundtable presentation - a 45-minute oral presentation given to families, Unity faculty, and community members, and;

 * A skillful team of devoted educators who inspire students to be their best selves, coupling high expectations with high support, and serving as role models for students. Unity's educators are lifelong learners who take the utmost pride in perfecting their craft:
    * Over 50% of our teachers coach athletic teams, lead enrichment clubs, or teach summer courses
    * Our students have benefitted from a teacher retention rate of 80% over the past two years

 * Expanded time for learning, including a 12-month calendar year for select students that allows for differentiation, universal growth, enrichment, and acceleration:
    * 25% of our students experience academic and extracurricular programming over a full calendar year; this subpopulation represents students who most benefit from more intensive support in order that they may meet NYS learning standards, earn a high school Regents diploma, and succeed in their postsecondary pursuits

 * Highly customized support and specialized counseling throughout students' time at Unity and beyond - this includes a staff-to-student ratio of 5:1 with a majority of courses as co-taught, along with intensive counseling from our five full-time academic counselors and four full-time social workers
 * A positive and supportive discipline system & school culture built on a framework of Positive Behavioral Interventions & Supports (PBIS) in which sound character traits, healthy habits, and strong socio-emotional skills are explicitly taught and cultivated by compassionate adults:

    * Best practices in restorative justice are commonly utilized, including circles and mediation

Who We Are

Phoenix Charter Academy aims to show the world what all young people can do, and to defy the limitations of societal assumptions, classism, and racism. Phoenix Charter Academy was founded on the unwavering belief that all students can succeed at high levels. While this mantra is typical of high-performing schools, particularly those in the charter sector, Phoenix truly endeavors to reach every student, focusing on a growing number on the margins of the traditional public district education system: students who have dropped out of high school, students who are parenting children of their own, students who are or have been involved with the juvenile justice system, students who are older and new to the country and cannot gain access to public schooling, and students who are under-credited relative to the number of years they have spent enrolled in high school. We believe that these students, like all students, are completely capable of developing the skills necessary to set themselves up for lifetimes of economic prosperity and success. We support our students with individually tailored and academically rigorous curricula and push them to succeed at the highest levels by providing them with the resources and mentoring that they need to reach their full potential.

Why Our Work is Important

Students across America are dropping out of high school at an alarming rate. Dropping out of high school has a substantial impact on a young person’s life. Over the course of their lifetime, an individual who drops out of high school is more likely to have reduced earning power, greater social service dependency, increased rates of criminal involvement, and shorter life expectancy. Phoenix Charter Academies addresses this trend by creating environments where students can demonstrate their talent and resilience and prepare themselves for success through high school, college, and beyond.

Commitment to DEI

At Phoenix, we recognize the importance of forming a school community inclusive of all visible and invisible identities. We act to ensure that our students and staff always see reflections of themselves and their communities.

At Phoenix, we aim to break down systemic barriers by providing access to resources, experiences, and differentiated supports for historically marginalized groups.

At Phoenix, we solicit, value, understand, connect, and leverage multiple perspectives and experiences. We invite all perspectives except those that perpetuate oppression or dehumanization.

At Phoenix we do not just accept difference - we celebrate it, support it, and thrive on it for the benefit of our scholars and the communities we serve. We believe difference makes us stronger. Phoenix Charter Academy is an equal opportunity employer and as such, we do not discriminate against any team member or candidate because of race, creed, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, national origin, disability, age, veteran status, marital status, pregnancy, or any other basis protected by federal, state or local law. Phoenix Charter Academy is committed to making any reasonable accommodations necessary to support an individual's employment.

Qualities Of Phoenix Staff Member


 * Unwavering belief in our students - Phoenix staff operate with the deeply held belief that all young people want to and can succeed even in the face of substantial systemic barriers and societal constraints.
 * Continuous Improvement - Phoenix staff approach problem solving with curiosity and desire to understand the perspectives of others. They carry an internalized sense of “I can always learn more” and know that adults at Phoenix must model the qualities of being open-minded and willing to make mistakes and learn from them. Phoenix staff members embody “lifelong learner” mindsets and strive for constant improvement.
 * Eager to Learn - Phoenix staff must be able to learn as they go in a fast-paced, ever-evolving, urgent environment. They have the desire to receive direct feedback and the ability to implement the feedback into practice quickly.
 * Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion - Phoenix staff commit to understanding how their self-identity and experiences impact and interact with their daily work, colleagues, and students, and work toward furthering initiatives that promote a more equitable society.

About The Springfield Empowerment Zone Partnership

While Massachusetts is consistently ranked as one of the top states for education results in the country, we have one of the highest and most persistent opportunity gaps. The Springfield Empowerment Zone Partnership (SEZP) - established in 2015 as a collaboration between Springfield Public Schools (SPS), the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE), and the Springfield Education Association (SEA) - seeks to improve the longitudinal life outcomes of the nearly 5,000 students in our seventeen middle and high schools.

As a ""zone"" of schools within the city of Springfield, SEZP's approach draws on a deep and embedded partnership with the school district and local teachers' union, while harnessing the flexibility and innovation found in autonomous school models. As a result, each school within SEZP is accorded significant school-based autonomies - in curriculum, talent, calendar, schedule, and budget - while being held accountable for realizing achievement gains for historically marginalized students. In all of our work, SEZP is in pursuit of equity and anti-racism - acknowledging the systemic oppression our students and families encounter daily and working to disrupt these provision gaps urgently and courageously.

About The Springfield Empowerment Zone Partnership

While Massachusetts is consistently ranked as one of the top states for education results in the country, we have one of the highest and most persistent opportunity gaps. The Springfield Empowerment Zone Partnership (SEZP) - established in 2015 as a collaboration between Springfield Public Schools (SPS), the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE), and the Springfield Education Association (SEA) - seeks to improve the longitudinal life outcomes of the nearly 5,000 students in our seventeen middle and high schools.

As a ""zone"" of schools within the city of Springfield, SEZP's approach draws on a deep and embedded partnership with the school district and local teachers' union, while harnessing the flexibility and innovation found in autonomous school models. As a result, each school within SEZP is accorded significant school-based autonomies - in curriculum, talent, calendar, schedule, and budget - while being held accountable for realizing achievement gains for historically marginalized students. In all of our work, SEZP is in pursuit of equity and anti-racism - acknowledging the systemic oppression our students and families encounter daily and working to disrupt these provision gaps urgently and courageously.

What if all students graduated high school with the knowledge, skills and habits they need to lead a fulfilled life? This is the question that guides our mission at Summit Public Schools.

Summit is a leading network of public schools that prepare a diverse student population for success in a four-year college and to be thoughtful, contributing members of society. We operate 12 schools serving over 4,500 students in the Bay Area and Washington state. 100% of Summit graduates are college ready and Summit graduates complete college at double the national average.

We need exceptional, diverse, and mission-aligned teachers to join our team to help prepare our students for a fulfilled life. Join us!

The Summit Model:

Summit's research-backed model makes teaching and learning at a Summit school unlike any other.

At Summit, our teachers mentor the same group of students each year in advisory groups, which allows them to build strong relationships based on deep trust over multiple years. Mentors meet 1:1 with each student regularly to coach students toward their personal goals, and meet daily as a mentor group.

During Project Time, teachers teach universal skills through real-world projects - using their subject-area expertise to help students apply their knowledge to the world around them. Through our research-backed curriculum, Summit gives teachers the tools they need so that they can focus on teaching and becoming the best project-based teachers in the world.

We are deeply committed to continuous improvement at Summit, both as an organization and for our individual faculty. With dedicated days of professional development built into the academic year, regular coaching sessions with a school leader, and a culture of honest, actionable, and timely feedback, we equip our teachers with the tools necessary to improve their practice and tackle challenging issues. We also prioritize developing leaders from within and have invested in multiple career pathway programs for our teachers and school leaders.

Summit has intensive collaboration structures built in to our weekly schedules. Teachers collaborate at the grade and subject levels, forming regular communities of practice to support each other in continuously improving as project-based teachers and mentors.

By design, our schools are small communities where every student is known. They are intentionally heterogeneous and reflect the diversity of the communities in which we operate. As a teacher, this will require being culturally responsive and creating equitable learning pathways for all students.

What You'll Do:


 * See sample teacher schedules here. A student school day is around 8-8:30am to 3-3:30pm, depending on the specific school. Teachers day's shall begin no earlier than 8:00 a.m. and end no later than 5:00 p.m. on any given workday.
 * Project Time: Teach 90-minute blocks in high school or four 55-minute blocks in middle school, per day of project time. Most teachers teach one course for the entire grade (e.g. 9th Grade Biology), and see each section twice per week. Teachers work with students on projects that develop cognitive skills and apply their content knowledge to real-world situations. Teachers facilitate discussions in the classroom, coach students in applying their cognitive skills, and give students feedback. Between teaching blocks, teachers analyze student data, build lesson plans, support school culture, and other personal development activities. Summit teachers build lesson plans through a deep understanding of student progress data, which determines the group and individual supports needed for their students to succeed.
 * Mentor Time: Build deep relationships and sense of community when teachers meet with their small group of mentees daily for their entire time at Summit. Daily, teachers meet with their mentor groups, work on habits of success as a group, and check in one-on-one with their mentees. Mentors coach and advocate for their mentees both inside and outside of the classroom, and strive to support them as they develop their sense of purpose as they become self-directed learners.
 * Self-Directed Learning Time and Interventions: Facilitate Self Directed Learning time and daily literacy or math interventions, which don't involve lesson planning. During this time, teachers provide student support, monitor progress, and check in with individuals or groups of students.
 * Collaboration & Professional Development: Twice a week, teachers participate in all-faculty after-school meetings where community decisions are made, professional development takes place, and faculty collaborates as a grade-level team or subject-level team.
   
   

What You Need:


 * Commitment to uphold Summit's values, and the belief that all children deserve a rigorous and equitable education that prepares them for college and for life
 * Teaching Credential in California or another US state
 * Bachelor's Degree (a Master's Degree in Education is preferred, but not required)
 * Clear health and background check
 * Teaching experience in your subject preferred, but not required
   
   

Who You Are:


 * You want to be a world-class project-based learning teacher
 * You thrive while collaborating and are excited to work with mission-aligned, high-performing colleagues. You find positivity in shared successes.
 * You're excited to teach Summit's common curriculum and assessment system, which was designed for teachers and by teachers in partnership with learning scientists.
 * You care deeply about working in intentionally heterogeneous schools and are ready to support all diverse students to reach a fulfilled life
 * You're eager to engage in professional development and be developed as a practitioner in a network that is committed to continuous improvement.
 * You have a growth mindset and see feedback as a positive
 * You are passionate about serving as a mentor and advocate for a group of students that you'll follow year to year. You're open to having hard conversations to support students.
   
   

What You Get:

In addition to joining a highly motivated team and engaging in meaningful work, you'll have access to a comprehensive suite of benefits including a retirement plan, ""take what you need"" PTO policy, 12 paid holidays, and 3 weeks of organization-wide closures during the year. You and your dependents will have access to multiple health, dental, and vision plans at 25% cost (we cover the other 75%) and employee life and disability insurance at no cost.

What if all students graduated high school with the knowledge, skills and habits they need to lead a fulfilled life? This is the question that guides our mission at Summit Public Schools.

Summit is a leading network of public schools that prepare a diverse student population for success in a four-year college and to be thoughtful, contributing members of society. We operate 12 schools serving over 4,500 students in the Bay Area and Washington state. 100% of Summit graduates are college ready and Summit graduates complete college at double the national average.

We need exceptional, diverse, and mission-aligned teachers to join our team to help prepare our students for a fulfilled life. Join us!

The Summit Model:

Summit's research-backed model makes teaching and learning at a Summit school unlike any other.

At Summit, our teachers mentor the same group of students each year in advisory groups, which allows them to build strong relationships based on deep trust over multiple years. Mentors meet 1:1 with each student regularly to coach students toward their personal goals, and meet daily as a mentor group.

During Project Time, teachers teach universal skills through real-world projects - using their subject-area expertise to help students apply their knowledge to the world around them. Through our research-backed curriculum, Summit gives teachers the tools they need so that they can focus on teaching and becoming the best project-based teachers in the world.

We are deeply committed to continuous improvement at Summit, both as an organization and for our individual faculty. With dedicated days of professional development built into the academic year, regular coaching sessions with a school leader, and a culture of honest, actionable, and timely feedback, we equip our teachers with the tools necessary to improve their practice and tackle challenging issues. We also prioritize developing leaders from within and have invested in multiple career pathway programs for our teachers and school leaders.

Summit has intensive collaboration structures built in to our weekly schedules. Teachers collaborate at the grade and subject levels, forming regular communities of practice to support each other in continuously improving as project-based teachers and mentors.

By design, our schools are small communities where every student is known. They are intentionally heterogeneous and reflect the diversity of the communities in which we operate. As a teacher, this will require being culturally responsive and creating equitable learning pathways for all students.

What You'll Do:


 * See sample teacher schedules here. A student school day is around 8-8:30am to 3-3:30pm, depending on the specific school. Teachers day's shall begin no earlier than 8:00 a.m. and end no later than 5:00 p.m. on any given workday.
 * Project Time: Teach 90-minute blocks in high school or four 55-minute blocks in middle school, per day of project time. Most teachers teach one course for the entire grade (e.g. 9th Grade Biology), and see each section twice per week. Teachers work with students on projects that develop cognitive skills and apply their content knowledge to real-world situations. Teachers facilitate discussions in the classroom, coach students in applying their cognitive skills, and give students feedback. Between teaching blocks, teachers analyze student data, build lesson plans, support school culture, and other personal development activities. Summit teachers build lesson plans through a deep understanding of student progress data, which determines the group and individual supports needed for their students to succeed.
 * Mentor Time: Build deep relationships and sense of community when teachers meet with their small group of mentees daily for their entire time at Summit. Daily, teachers meet with their mentor groups, work on habits of success as a group, and check in one-on-one with their mentees. Mentors coach and advocate for their mentees both inside and outside of the classroom, and strive to support them as they develop their sense of purpose as they become self-directed learners.
 * Self-Directed Learning Time and Interventions: Facilitate Self Directed Learning time and daily literacy or math interventions, which don't involve lesson planning. During this time, teachers provide student support, monitor progress, and check in with individuals or groups of students.
 * Collaboration & Professional Development: Twice a week, teachers participate in all-faculty after-school meetings where community decisions are made, professional development takes place, and faculty collaborates as a grade-level team or subject-level team.
   
   

What You Need:


 * Commitment to uphold Summit's values, and the belief that all children deserve a rigorous and equitable education that prepares them for college and for life
 * Teaching Credential in California or another US state
 * Bachelor's Degree (a Master's Degree in Education is preferred, but not required)
 * Clear health and background check
 * Teaching experience in your subject preferred, but not required
   
   

Who You Are:


 * You want to be a world-class project-based learning teacher
 * You thrive while collaborating and are excited to work with mission-aligned, high-performing colleagues. You find positivity in shared successes.
 * You're excited to teach Summit's common curriculum and assessment system, which was designed for teachers and by teachers in partnership with learning scientists.
 * You care deeply about working in intentionally heterogeneous schools and are ready to support all diverse students to reach a fulfilled life
 * You're eager to engage in professional development and be developed as a practitioner in a network that is committed to continuous improvement.
 * You have a growth mindset and see feedback as a positive
 * You are passionate about serving as a mentor and advocate for a group of students that you'll follow year to year. You're open to having hard conversations to support students.
   
   

What You Get:

In addition to joining a highly motivated team and engaging in meaningful work, you'll have access to a comprehensive suite of benefits including a retirement plan, ""take what you need"" PTO policy, 12 paid holidays, and 3 weeks of organization-wide closures during the year.

Applicants must meet the minimum educational requirements listed in order to be considered for the pool of qualified candidates. All decisions are made upon the discretion of the department. Applicants who meet the minimum requirements are not automatically accepted to teach at Viterbo.

As this is for a pool of applicants, it may take time before you hear anything. If a dean or chair of a department has already reached out to you to teach, please continue with the application process to confirm your interest.

Applicants should upload cover letter indicating area of discipline along with a current vita. If recommended for a position, official transcripts will be required prior to a contract being issued.

Minimum Academic Qualifications: The expectation is that individuals who teach at the undergraduate level will typically hold a master's or higher in the discipline or subfield in which they teach.

Minimum Professional Experience: For individuals who hold a master's degree in a related field and do not have 18 credits directly in the subfield they will be teaching in or a masters in an unrelated field, candidates may meet academic qualification through recent professional experience and expertise (work experience, publications, licensure, presentations, or equivalent within the last five years).


 * For adjunct pool positions, you will only be contacted in the event your academic and/or professional experiences are a match for an immediate adjunct need.

What if all students graduated high school with the knowledge, skills and habits they need to lead a fulfilled life? This is the question that guides our mission at Summit Public Schools.

Summit is a leading network of public schools that prepare a diverse student population for success in a four-year college and to be thoughtful, contributing members of society. We operate 12 schools serving over 4,500 students in the Bay Area and Washington state. 100% of Summit graduates are college ready and Summit graduates complete college at double the national average.

We need exceptional, diverse, and mission-aligned teachers to join our team to help prepare our students for a fulfilled life. Join us!

The Summit Model:

Summit's research-backed model makes teaching and learning at a Summit school unlike any other.

At Summit, our teachers mentor the same group of students each year in advisory groups, which allows them to build strong relationships based on deep trust over multiple years. Mentors meet 1:1 with each student regularly to coach students toward their personal goals, and meet daily as a mentor group.

During Project Time, teachers teach universal skills through real-world projects - using their subject-area expertise to help students apply their knowledge to the world around them. Through our research-backed curriculum, Summit gives teachers the tools they need so that they can focus on teaching and becoming the best project-based teachers in the world.

We are deeply committed to continuous improvement at Summit, both as an organization and for our individual faculty. With dedicated days of professional development built into the academic year, regular coaching sessions with a school leader, and a culture of honest, actionable, and timely feedback, we equip our teachers with the tools necessary to improve their practice and tackle challenging issues. We also prioritize developing leaders from within and have invested in multiple career pathway programs for our teachers and school leaders.

Summit has intensive collaboration structures built in to our weekly schedules. Teachers collaborate at the grade and subject levels, forming regular communities of practice to support each other in continuously improving as project-based teachers and mentors.

By design, our schools are small communities where every student is known. They are intentionally heterogeneous and reflect the diversity of the communities in which we operate. As a teacher, this will require being culturally responsive and creating equitable learning pathways for all students.

What You'll Do:


 * See sample teacher schedules here. A student school day is around 8-8:30am to 3-3:30pm, depending on the specific school. Teachers day's shall begin no earlier than 8:00 a.m. and end no later than 5:00 p.m. on any given workday.
 * Project Time: Teach 90-minute blocks in high school or four 55-minute blocks in middle school, per day of project time. Most teachers teach one course for the entire grade (e.g. 9th Grade Biology), and see each section twice per week. Teachers work with students on projects that develop cognitive skills and apply their content knowledge to real-world situations. Teachers facilitate discussions in the classroom, coach students in applying their cognitive skills, and give students feedback. Between teaching blocks, teachers analyze student data, build lesson plans, support school culture, and other personal development activities. Summit teachers build lesson plans through a deep understanding of student progress data, which determines the group and individual supports needed for their students to succeed.
 * Mentor Time: Build deep relationships and sense of community when teachers meet with their small group of mentees daily for their entire time at Summit. Daily, teachers meet with their mentor groups, work on habits of success as a group, and check in one-on-one with their mentees. Mentors coach and advocate for their mentees both inside and outside of the classroom, and strive to support them as they develop their sense of purpose as they become self-directed learners.
 * Self-Directed Learning Time and Interventions: Facilitate Self Directed Learning time and daily literacy or math interventions, which don't involve lesson planning. During this time, teachers provide student support, monitor progress, and check in with individuals or groups of students.
 * Collaboration & Professional Development: Twice a week, teachers participate in all-faculty after-school meetings where community decisions are made, professional development takes place, and faculty collaborates as a grade-level team or subject-level team.
   
   

What You Need:


 * Commitment to uphold Summit's values, and the belief that all children deserve a rigorous and equitable education that prepares them for college and for life
 * Teaching Credential in California or another US state
 * Bachelor's Degree (a Master's Degree in Education is preferred, but not required)
 * Clear health and background check
 * Teaching experience in your subject preferred, but not required
   
   

Who You Are:


 * You want to be a world-class project-based learning teacher
 * You thrive while collaborating and are excited to work with mission-aligned, high-performing colleagues. You find positivity in shared successes.
 * You're excited to teach Summit's common curriculum and assessment system, which was designed for teachers and by teachers in partnership with learning scientists.
 * You care deeply about working in intentionally heterogeneous schools and are ready to support all diverse students to reach a fulfilled life
 * You're eager to engage in professional development and be developed as a practitioner in a network that is committed to continuous improvement.
 * You have a growth mindset and see feedback as a positive
 * You are passionate about serving as a mentor and advocate for a group of students that you'll follow year to year. You're open to having hard conversations to support students.
   
   

What You Get:

In addition to joining a highly motivated team and engaging in meaningful work, you'll have access to a comprehensive suite of benefits including a retirement plan, ""take what you need"" PTO policy, 12 paid holidays, and 3 weeks of organization-wide closures during the year. You and your dependents will have access to multiple health, dental, and vision plans at 25% cost (we cover the other 75%) and employee life and disability insurance at no cost. Our compensation policy strives to be equitable and transparent. The salary for this position starts at $61,776 and goes up to $96,938 commensurate with experience and qualifications.

Summit is an equal opportunity employer. We believe that diversity, equity, and inclusion are directly intertwined with education. We are ALL better when we are able to bring our whole selves to work and honor each other's voices across identities, cultural backgrounds, and life experiences. We welcome and encourage applications from individuals who are members of historically marginalized communities. Spanish language proficiency is a plus.

About The School Of Rhetoric

Our High Schools unofficial motto might be work hard, play hard, laugh hard. Though rigorous in curriculum and expectations, our student body is made up of academically average and above average students, almost all of whom are involved in Athletics, Performing and Visual Arts, clubs and societies, and service to the school and community. Ours is a balance of exhorting students to not accept low expectations for what young people can do while also helping them make hard decisions between multiple ""excellent"" things.

At the center of our education in the high school are analysis and critical thinking--the students' ability and exercise of understanding and ordering their knowledge on any particular topic into the context of their understanding of everything else. Articulating in writing and speech both questions and understanding are therefore regular and constant activity in all subjects. We deliberately foster an environment that encourages mature personal relationships and individual study. While education inherently includes graded performance on assessments and tests which can foster anxiety and unhealthy competition, the environment most conducive to learning is relaxed, personal, and safe--a result of relationships with adults whom are trustworthy, caring, and supportive. Those relationships are the most important asset in our school.

About The Springfield Empowerment Zone Partnership

While Massachusetts is consistently ranked as one of the top states for education results in the country, we have one of the highest and most persistent opportunity gaps. The Springfield Empowerment Zone Partnership (SEZP) - established in 2015 as a collaboration between Springfield Public Schools (SPS), the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE), and the Springfield Education Association (SEA) - seeks to improve the longitudinal life outcomes of the nearly 5,000 students in our seventeen middle and high schools.

As a ""zone"" of schools within the city of Springfield, SEZP's approach draws on a deep and embedded partnership with the school district and local teachers' union, while harnessing the flexibility and innovation found in autonomous school models. As a result, each school within SEZP is accorded significant school-based autonomies - in curriculum, talent, calendar, schedule, and budget - while being held accountable for realizing achievement gains for historically marginalized students. In all of our work, SEZP is in pursuit of equity and anti-racism - acknowledging the systemic oppression our students and families encounter daily and working to disrupt these provision gaps urgently and courageously.

What if all students graduated high school with the knowledge, skills and habits they need to lead a fulfilled life? This is the question that guides our mission at Summit Public Schools.

Summit is a leading network of public schools that prepare a diverse student population for success in a four-year college and to be thoughtful, contributing members of society. We operate 12 schools serving over 4,500 students in the Bay Area and Washington state. 100% of Summit graduates are college ready and Summit graduates complete college at double the national average.

We need exceptional, diverse, and mission-aligned teachers to join our team to help prepare our students for a fulfilled life. Join us!

The Summit Model:

Summit's research-backed model makes teaching and learning at a Summit school unlike any other.

At Summit, our teachers mentor the same group of students each year in advisory groups, which allows them to build strong relationships based on deep trust over multiple years. Mentors meet 1:1 with each student regularly to coach students toward their personal goals, and meet daily as a mentor group.

During Project Time, teachers teach universal skills through real-world projects - using their subject-area expertise to help students apply their knowledge to the world around them. Through our research-backed curriculum, Summit gives teachers the tools they need so that they can focus on teaching and becoming the best project-based teachers in the world.

We are deeply committed to continuous improvement at Summit, both as an organization and for our individual faculty. With dedicated days of professional development built into the academic year, regular coaching sessions with a school leader, and a culture of honest, actionable, and timely feedback, we equip our teachers with the tools necessary to improve their practice and tackle challenging issues. We also prioritize developing leaders from within and have invested in multiple career pathway programs for our teachers and school leaders.

Summit has intensive collaboration structures built in to our weekly schedules. Teachers collaborate at the grade and subject levels, forming regular communities of practice to support each other in continuously improving as project-based teachers and mentors.

By design, our schools are small communities where every student is known. They are intentionally heterogeneous and reflect the diversity of the communities in which we operate. As a teacher, this will require being culturally responsive and creating equitable learning pathways for all students.

What You'll Do:


 * See sample teacher schedules here. A student school day is around 8-8:30am to 3-3:30pm, depending on the specific school. Teachers day's shall begin no earlier than 8:00 a.m. and end no later than 5:00 p.m. on any given workday.
 * Project Time: Teach 90-minute blocks in high school or four 55-minute blocks in middle school, per day of project time. Most teachers teach one course for the entire grade (e.g. 9th Grade Biology), and see each section twice per week. Teachers work with students on projects that develop cognitive skills and apply their content knowledge to real-world situations. Teachers facilitate discussions in the classroom, coach students in applying their cognitive skills, and give students feedback. Between teaching blocks, teachers analyze student data, build lesson plans, support school culture, and other personal development activities. Summit teachers build lesson plans through a deep understanding of student progress data, which determines the group and individual supports needed for their students to succeed.
 * Mentor Time: Build deep relationships and sense of community when teachers meet with their small group of mentees daily for their entire time at Summit. Daily, teachers meet with their mentor groups, work on habits of success as a group, and check in one-on-one with their mentees. Mentors coach and advocate for their mentees both inside and outside of the classroom, and strive to support them as they develop their sense of purpose as they become self-directed learners.
 * Self-Directed Learning Time and Interventions: Facilitate Self Directed Learning time and daily literacy or math interventions, which don't involve lesson planning. During this time, teachers provide student support, monitor progress, and check in with individuals or groups of students.
 * Collaboration & Professional Development: Twice a week, teachers participate in all-faculty after-school meetings where community decisions are made, professional development takes place, and faculty collaborates as a grade-level team or subject-level team.
   
   

What You Need:


 * Commitment to uphold Summit's values, and the belief that all children deserve a rigorous and equitable education that prepares them for college and for life
 * Teaching Credential in California or another US state
 * Bachelor's Degree (a Master's Degree in Education is preferred, but not required)
 * Clear health and background check
 * Teaching experience in your subject preferred, but not required
   
   

Who You Are:


 * You want to be a world-class project-based learning teacher
 * You thrive while collaborating and are excited to work with mission-aligned, high-performing colleagues. You find positivity in shared successes.
 * You're excited to teach Summit's common curriculum and assessment system, which was designed for teachers and by teachers in partnership with learning scientists.
 * You care deeply about working in intentionally heterogeneous schools and are ready to support all diverse students to reach a fulfilled life
 * You're eager to engage in professional development and be developed as a practitioner in a network that is committed to continuous improvement.
 * You have a growth mindset and see feedback as a positive
 * You are passionate about serving as a mentor and advocate for a group of students that you'll follow year to year. You're open to having hard conversations to support students.
   
   

What You Get:

In addition to joining a highly motivated team and engaging in meaningful work, you'll have access to a comprehensive suite of benefits including a retirement plan, ""take what you need"" PTO policy, 12 paid holidays, and 3 weeks of organization-wide closures during the year. You and your dependents will have access to multiple health, dental, and vision plans at 25% cost (we cover the other 75%) and employee life and disability insurance at no cost. Our compensation policy strives to be equitable and transparent. The salary for this position starts at $61,776 and goes up to $96,938 commensurate with experience and qualifications.

Summit is an equal opportunity employer. We believe that diversity, equity, and inclusion are directly intertwined with education.

About The Springfield Empowerment Zone Partnership

While Massachusetts is consistently ranked as one of the top states for education results in the country, we have one of the highest and most persistent opportunity gaps. The Springfield Empowerment Zone Partnership (SEZP) - established in 2015 as a collaboration between Springfield Public Schools (SPS), the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE), and the Springfield Education Association (SEA) - seeks to improve the longitudinal life outcomes of the nearly 5,000 students in our seventeen middle and high schools.

As a ""zone"" of schools within the city of Springfield, SEZP's approach draws on a deep and embedded partnership with the school district and local teachers' union, while harnessing the flexibility and innovation found in autonomous school models. As a result, each school within SEZP is accorded significant school-based autonomies - in curriculum, talent, calendar, schedule, and budget - while being held accountable for realizing achievement gains for historically marginalized students. In all of our work, SEZP is in pursuit of equity and anti-racism - acknowledging the systemic oppression our students and families encounter daily and working to disrupt these provision gaps urgently and courageously.

Position Summary

Blueprint Math Fellows are tutors charged with providing students with highly personalized tutoring in mathematics during the regular school day. Fellows work with 4 - 8 students at a time, delivering individualized lessons and working closely with teachers to accelerate students’ academic achievement. Fellows also work to build strong relationships with students to help increase their self-confidence and commitment to education. Our students see their Fellows as mentors, advocates and as passionate adults who make learning math understandable and fun.

While teachers have classrooms of 25 or 30 students, Fellows work with small groups of students. This allows for the individualization of remedial and supplemental instruction in a safe space, where students are encouraged to engage with one another and explain their thinking. Fellows individualize lessons to meet the needs, interests, and passions of their students and deliver data-driven instruction that not only significantly impacts student achievement, but inspires students to be lifelong learners. By using math as the vehicle, Fellows foster critical thinkers, confident communicators, and engaged citizens who question, reflect, self assess, visualize, respond positively to feedback, persevere, and internalize goal setting as a tool for continuous self-improvement.

Fellows receive curriculum materials, pre-service training, on-going mentoring and professional development as well as written evaluation of feedback from their assigned Site Manager.

Who We Are

Phoenix Charter Academy aims to show the world what all young people can do, and to defy the limitations of societal assumptions, classism, and racism. Phoenix Charter Academy was founded on the unwavering belief that all students can succeed at high levels. While this mantra is typical of high-performing schools, particularly those in the charter sector, Phoenix truly endeavors to reach every student, focusing on a growing number on the margins of the traditional public district education system: students who have dropped out of high school, students who are parenting children of their own, students who are or have been involved with the juvenile justice system, students who are older and new to the country and cannot gain access to public schooling, and students who are under-credited relative to the number of years they have spent enrolled in high school. We believe that these students, like all students, are completely capable of developing the skills necessary to set themselves up for lifetimes of economic prosperity and success. We support our students with individually tailored and academically rigorous curricula and push them to succeed at the highest levels by providing them with the resources and mentoring that they need to reach their full potential.

Why Our Work is Important

Students across America are dropping out of high school at an alarming rate. Dropping out of high school has a substantial impact on a young person’s life. Over the course of their lifetime, an individual who drops out of high school is more likely to have reduced earning power, greater social service dependency, increased rates of criminal involvement, and shorter life expectancy. Phoenix Charter Academies addresses this trend by creating environments where students can demonstrate their talent and resilience and prepare themselves for success through high school, college, and beyond.

Commitment to DEI

At Phoenix, we recognize the importance of forming a school community inclusive of all visible and invisible identities. We act to ensure that our students and staff always see reflections of themselves and their communities.

At Phoenix, we aim to break down systemic barriers by providing access to resources, experiences, and differentiated supports for historically marginalized groups.

At Phoenix, we solicit, value, understand, connect, and leverage multiple perspectives and experiences. We invite all perspectives except those that perpetuate oppression or dehumanization.

At Phoenix we do not just accept difference - we celebrate it, support it, and thrive on it for the benefit of our scholars and the communities we serve. We believe difference makes us stronger. Phoenix Charter Academy is an equal opportunity employer and as such, we do not discriminate against any team member or candidate because of race, creed, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, national origin, disability, age, veteran status, marital status, pregnancy, or any other basis protected by federal, state or local law. Phoenix Charter Academy is committed to making any reasonable accommodations necessary to support an individual's employment.

Qualities Of Phoenix Staff Member


 * Unwavering belief in our students - Phoenix staff operate with the deeply held belief that all young people want to and can succeed even in the face of substantial systemic barriers and societal constraints.
 * Continuous Improvement - Phoenix staff approach problem solving with curiosity and desire to understand the perspectives of others. They carry an internalized sense of “I can always learn more” and know that adults at Phoenix must model the qualities of being open-minded and willing to make mistakes and learn from them. Phoenix staff members embody “lifelong learner” mindsets and strive for constant improvement.
 * Eager to Learn - Phoenix staff must be able to learn as they go in a fast-paced, ever-evolving, urgent environment. They have the desire to receive direct feedback and the ability to implement the feedback into practice quickly.
 * Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion - Phoenix staff commit to understanding how their self-identity and experiences impact and interact with their daily work, colleagues, and students, and work toward furthering initiatives that promote a more equitable society.
   
   

What You’ll Bring

Please RSVP here!

To Apply:

To apply, you must submit an application through The Equity Project (TEP) Charter School website here.

The first stage of the process is the application below. In order to be considered, you must submit an application that consists of all four components: 1 - Resume, 2 - Cover letter, 3 - Instructional Video, and 4 - Submission of Teaching and Learning. The requirements for each of the four components are specified in detail below.


 * RESUME: Please submit an up-to-date resume
 * COVER LETTER: Please submit a well-written cover letter that highlights your specific interest in joining the TEP community
 * INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO: Please submit an unedited video clip (maximum 15 minutes) of you teaching in a classroom setting (preferred) or a small-group setting. It is preferred that the students be in the same grade-level as the TEP teaching position for which you are applying, though this is not a strict requirement. The video may contain only one continuous, unedited clip (i.e. do not splice together multiple clips from different points in the lesson). The clip does not need to show an entire lesson; a brief lesson segment is perfectly acceptable
   
   

If you do not have a video with students in the classroom you may still submit a video of yourself teaching. Get creative! You may include a video of you teaching (a) a lesson with/for no students, (b) a lesson of you teaching family members, (c) or a lesson for students virtually. We’re excited to see your creativity.

The video must be accompanied by a written narrative that analyzes and reflects upon the teaching and learning that occurs in the lesson and may offer an explanation as to what occurred prior to and subsequent to the clip. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative. The video may be submitted in any format, but a link to a video posted online is preferred.


 * SUBMISSION OF TEACHING AND LEARNING: Submit one of the following three options:
   
   

Option A: Portfolio of Student Work that demonstrates the progress of at least two specific students that you have taught. The portfolio must contain a minimum of two work products for each student (for a minimum of four work products) completed at different points in time during the period when each student was in your class. The portfolio must be accompanied by a written narrative that analyzes and reflects upon the progress that each student demonstrates. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative.

Option B: Assessment Data for at least one entire class of students that you have taught. The assessments may be standardized national, state, or city assessments or your own self-created assessments. The assessment data can be provided in any form that you choose (official documents with students’ last names crossed-out, or documents that you create to summarize student assessment performance). The data you provide should ideally show progress over time; as such, it is recommended (though not required) that you provide data for at least two assessments taken at different points in time. The assessment data must be accompanied by a copy of the assessments themselves. If a specific assessment is unavailable, provide a copy of a similar assessment. The assessment data must also be accompanied by a written narrative that provides background on the assessments, explains how the assessments measure student performance, and analyzes the results of your class. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative.

Option C: Original Curricular Tool of any form that you have personally developed. The requirement here is deliberately open-ended because we are interested in seeing anything that you have developed that you believe has meaningfully supported your students' learning. This may take the form of written materials, a unique instructional methodology, a technological innovation, etc. The curricular tool must also be accompanied by a written narrative that provides background on the tool, how the tool functions, and speaks to the impact of the tool within your classroom. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative.","Be among the first 25 applicants","Full-time","Associate","Education","Technology, Information and Internet",""

About The Springfield Empowerment Zone Partnership

While Massachusetts is consistently ranked as one of the top states for education results in the country, we have one of the highest and most persistent opportunity gaps. The Springfield Empowerment Zone Partnership (SEZP) - established in 2015 as a collaboration between Springfield Public Schools (SPS), the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE), and the Springfield Education Association (SEA) - seeks to improve the longitudinal life outcomes of the more than 5,000 students in our eleven middle and high schools.

As a ""zone"" of schools within the city of Springfield, SEZP's approach draws on a deep and embedded partnership with the school district and local teachers' union, while harnessing the flexibility and innovation found in autonomous school models. As a result, each school within SEZP is accorded significant school-based autonomies - in curriculum, talent, calendar, schedule, and budget - while being held accountable for realizing achievement gains for historically marginalized students. In all of our work, SEZP is in pursuit of equity and anti-racism - acknowledging the systemic oppression our students and families encounter daily and working to disrupt these provision gaps urgently and courageously.

Position Summary

Blueprint Math Fellows are tutors charged with providing students with highly personalized tutoring in mathematics during the regular school day. Fellows work with 4 - 8 students at a time, delivering individualized lessons and working closely with teachers to accelerate students’ academic achievement. Fellows also work to build strong relationships with students to help increase their self-confidence and commitment to education. Our students see their Fellows as mentors, advocates and as passionate adults who make learning math understandable and fun.

While teachers have classrooms of 25 or 30 students, Fellows work with small groups of students. This allows for the individualization of remedial and supplemental instruction in a safe space, where students are encouraged to engage with one another and explain their thinking. Fellows individualize lessons to meet the needs, interests, and passions of their students and deliver data-driven instruction that not only significantly impacts student achievement, but inspires students to be lifelong learners. By using math as the vehicle, Fellows foster critical thinkers, confident communicators, and engaged citizens who question, reflect, self assess, visualize, respond positively to feedback, persevere, and internalize goal setting as a tool for continuous self-improvement.

Fellows receive curriculum materials, pre-service training, on-going mentoring and professional development as well as written evaluation of feedback from their assigned Site Manager. Fellows are charged with focusing on the individual needs of their students, helping to accelerate student achievement and close any skill gaps that may exist.

About The Springfield Empowerment Zone Partnership

While Massachusetts is consistently ranked as one of the top states for education results in the country, we have one of the highest and most persistent opportunity gaps. The Springfield Empowerment Zone Partnership (SEZP) - established in 2015 as a collaboration between Springfield Public Schools (SPS), the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE), and the Springfield Education Association (SEA) – seeks to improve the longitudinal life outcomes of the nearly 5,000 students in our seventeen middle and high schools.

As a “zone” of schools within the city of Springfield, SEZP’s approach draws on a deep and embedded partnership with the school district and local teachers’ union, while harnessing the flexibility and innovation found in autonomous school models. As a result, each school within SEZP is accorded significant school-based autonomies - in curriculum, talent, calendar, schedule, and budget – while being held accountable for realizing achievement gains for historically marginalized students. In all of our work, SEZP is in pursuit of equity and anti-racism – acknowledging the systemic oppression our students and families encounter daily and working to disrupt these provision gaps urgently and courageously.

Become a Certified Teacher







Who We Are

Nevada Teacher Corps prepares individuals without teaching certification to become teachers for the students who need them most – those in our most underserved communities, where systemic inequities and individual prejudices deny too many children access to a great education. Through Nevada Teacher Corps, you will elevate your academic and professional expertise into a high-impact career as a certified teacher in Clark County School District and various charter schools in the Las Vegas area.




Why Las Vegas

Nevada Teacher Corps (NTC) is a one-year ambitious, teacher-centered effort to invigorate underserved Nevada schools with great teaching and leadership. NTC builds a passionate group of dedicated aspiring teachers, and provides the training, coaching and leadership development they need to offer a transformative education for Nevada students.




Nevada Teacher Corps provides an accelerated pathway into teaching for individuals who aren’t yet certified as educators, but who possess the dedication and content knowledge to teach in some of the highest-need schools throughout Las Vegas.




Who Our Students Need

We are looking for graduating seniors, recent college graduates, and professionals who possess the dedication and skills to teach Elementary Education, Early Childhood Education and Secondary Math.




You may have built a successful career, and now wish to give back as a teacher. You could be a recent graduate who wants to share your passion for learning with Nevada’s students. Whatever your background, you believe that every student can achieve at a high level and will do whatever it takes to help them get there.







Benefits of Nevada Teacher Corps

 * Community – Focused: As an international destination, Las Vegas is rich in diversity. Nevada Teacher Corps works across every level of our education system. We collaborate with the state department of education, individual schools, and with teachers, leaders, and community members at schools across Nevada.
 * Classroom – Centered Preparation: Fellows prepare to enter the classroom by participating in a six-week training experience. Where traditional teacher preparation leaves little time for hands-on skill-building, our innovative training is centered around actual teaching experience in summer school classrooms and focused practice on core skills, including reflecting on students’ values, experiences, and ambitions to create opportunities for students to see themselves in challenging content that will prepare them for success. There is no cost for this training, but Fellows are responsible for expenses related to pre-employment requirements such as state and district background checks, fingerprinting and state required certification exam fees.
 * Full Salary and Benefits: Nevada Teacher Corps Fellows are hired as full-time teachers by our school partners and will begin teaching for the 2024-25 school year. They receive the same compensation as all other first-year teachers, including a starting salary of $49,175 plus comprehensive benefits.
 * Certification: During the first year in the classroom, Fellows earn certification through our program which includes coursework and individualized support that builds on the skills mastered during training. NTC Fellows are recognized not simply as certified teachers, but as having a proven track record of classroom success. Tuition of $7,000 is payable in monthly installments, which are not due until Fellows start receiving a full-time salary.
 * Enrollment in TNTP’s AmeriCorps program offers an award up to $7,395 for education related expenses or previous student loans.




Eligibility for Nevada Teacher Corps:

 * Must have bachelor’s degree by June 2024.
 * Must currently be authorized to work in the U.S.
 * Must not already be a certified teacher.
 * Must be able to pass an FBI background investigation.
 * Must have a minimum 2.0 cumulative undergraduate GPA.

If you or a friend is interested in applying for a teaching position at TEP, join us for a virtual information session with TEP's Senior Leaders. Learn more about the teacher application process and what it's like to teach at TEP.

To Apply

To apply, you must submit an application through .

The first stage of the process is the application below. In order to be considered, you must submit an application that consists of all four components: 1 - Resume, 2 - Cover letter, 3 - Instructional Video, and 4 - Submission of Teaching and Learning. The requirements for each of the four components are specified in detail below.


 * RESUME: Please submit an up-to-date resume.
 * COVER LETTER: Please submit a well-written cover letter that highlights your specific interest in joining the TEP community.
 * INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO: Please submit an unedited video clip (maximum 15 minutes) of you teaching in a classroom setting (preferred) or a small-group setting. It is preferred that the students be in the same grade-level as the TEP teaching position for which you are applying, though this is not a strict requirement. The video may contain only one continuous, unedited clip (i.e. do not splice together multiple clips from different points in the lesson). The clip does not need to show an entire lesson; a brief lesson segment is perfectly acceptable.
   
   

If you do not have a video with students in the classroom you may still submit a video of yourself teaching. Get creative! You may include a video of you teaching (a) a lesson with/for no students, (b) a lesson of you teaching family members, (c) or a lesson for students virtually. We’re excited to see your creativity.

The video must be accompanied by a written narrative that analyzes and reflects upon the teaching and learning that occurs in the lesson and may offer an explanation as to what occurred prior to and subsequent to the clip. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative. The video may be submitted in any format, but a link to a video posted online is preferred.


 * SUBMISSION OF TEACHING AND LEARNING: Submit one of the following three options:
   
   

Option A: Portfolio of Student Work that demonstrates the progress of at least two specific students that you have taught. The portfolio must contain a minimum of two work products for each student (for a minimum of four work products) completed at different points in time during the period when each student was in your class. The portfolio must be accompanied by a written narrative that analyzes and reflects upon the progress that each student demonstrates. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative.

Option B: Assessment Data for at least one entire class of students that you have taught. The assessments may be standardized national, state, or city assessments or your own self-created assessments. The assessment data can be provided in any form that you choose (official documents with students’ last names crossed-out, or documents that you create to summarize student assessment performance). The data you provide should ideally show progress over time; as such, it is recommended (though not required) that you provide data for at least two assessments taken at different points in time. The assessment data must be accompanied by a copy of the assessments themselves. If a specific assessment is unavailable, provide a copy of a similar assessment. The assessment data must also be accompanied by a written narrative that provides background on the assessments, explains how the assessments measure student performance, and analyzes the results of your class. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative.

Option C: Original Curricular Tool of any form that you have personally developed. The requirement here is deliberately open-ended because we are interested in seeing anything that you have developed that you believe has meaningfully supported your students' learning.

Summit's research-backed model makes teaching and learning at a Summit school unlike any other.

At Summit, our teachers mentor the same group of students each year in advisory groups, which allows them to build strong relationships based on deep trust over multiple years. Mentors meet 1:1 with each student regularly to coach students toward their personal goals, and meet daily as a mentor group.

During Project Time, teachers teach universal skills through real-world projects - using their subject-area expertise to help students apply their knowledge to the world around them. Through our research-backed curriculum, Summit gives teachers the tools they need so that they can focus on teaching and becoming the best project-based teachers in the world.

We are deeply committed to continuous improvement at Summit, both as an organization and for our individual faculty. With dedicated days of professional development built into the academic year, regular coaching sessions with a school leader, and a culture of honest, actionable, and timely feedback, we equip our teachers with the tools necessary to improve their practice and tackle challenging issues. We also prioritize developing leaders from within and have invested in multiple career pathway programs for our teachers and school leaders.

Summit has intensive collaboration structures built in to our weekly schedules. Teachers collaborate at the grade and subject levels, forming regular communities of practice to support each other in continuously improving as project-based teachers and mentors.

By design, our schools are small communities where every student is known. They are intentionally heterogeneous and reflect the diversity of the communities in which we operate. As a teacher, this will require being culturally responsive and creating equitable learning pathways for all students.

What You'll Do:


 * See sample teacher schedules here. A student school day is around 8-8:30am to 3-3:30pm, depending on the specific school. Teachers day's shall begin no earlier than 8:00 a.m. and end no later than 5:00 p.m. on any given workday.
 * Project Time: Teach 90-minute blocks in high school or four 55-minute blocks in middle school, per day of project time. Most teachers teach one course for the entire grade (e.g. 9th Grade Biology), and see each section twice per week. Teachers work with students on projects that develop cognitive skills and apply their content knowledge to real-world situations. Teachers facilitate discussions in the classroom, coach students in applying their cognitive skills, and give students feedback. Between teaching blocks, teachers analyze student data, build lesson plans, support school culture, and other personal development activities. Summit teachers build lesson plans through a deep understanding of student progress data, which determines the group and individual supports needed for their students to succeed.
 * Mentor Time: Build deep relationships and sense of community when teachers meet with their small group of mentees daily for their entire time at Summit. Daily, teachers meet with their mentor groups, work on habits of success as a group, and check in one-on-one with their mentees. Mentors coach and advocate for their mentees both inside and outside of the classroom, and strive to support them as they develop their sense of purpose as they become self-directed learners.
 * Self-Directed Learning Time and Interventions: Facilitate Self Directed Learning time and daily literacy or math interventions, which don't involve lesson planning. During this time, teachers provide student support, monitor progress, and check in with individuals or groups of students.
 * Collaboration & Professional Development: Twice a week, teachers participate in all-faculty after-school meetings where community decisions are made, professional development takes place, and faculty collaborates as a grade-level team or subject-level team.
   
   

What You Need:


 * Commitment to uphold Summit's values, and the belief that all children deserve a rigorous and equitable education that prepares them for college and for life
 * Teaching Credential in California or another US state
 * Bachelor's Degree (a Master's Degree in Education is preferred, but not required)
 * Clear health and background check
 * Teaching experience in your subject preferred, but not required
   
   

Who You Are:


 * You want to be a world-class project-based learning teacher
 * You thrive while collaborating and are excited to work with mission-aligned, high-performing colleagues. You find positivity in shared successes.
 * You're excited to teach Summit's common curriculum and assessment system, which was designed for teachers and by teachers in partnership with learning scientists.
 * You care deeply about working in intentionally heterogeneous schools and are ready to support all diverse students to reach a fulfilled life
 * You're eager to engage in professional development and be developed as a practitioner in a network that is committed to continuous improvement.
 * You have a growth mindset and see feedback as a positive
 * You are passionate about serving as a mentor and advocate for a group of students that you'll follow year to year. You're open to having hard conversations to support students.
   
   

What You Get:

In addition to joining a highly motivated team and engaging in meaningful work, you'll have access to a comprehensive suite of benefits including a retirement plan, ""take what you need"" PTO policy, 12 paid holidays, and 3 weeks of organization-wide closures during the year. You and your dependents will have access to multiple health, dental, and vision plans at 25% cost (we cover the other 75%) and employee life and disability insurance at no cost. Our compensation policy strives to be equitable and transparent. The salary for this position starts at $61,776 and goes up to $96,938 commensurate with experience and qualifications.

What if all students graduated high school with the knowledge, skills and habits they need to lead a fulfilled life? This is the question that guides our mission at Summit Public Schools.

Summit is a leading network of public schools that prepare a diverse student population for success in a four-year college and to be thoughtful, contributing members of society. We operate 12 schools serving over 4,000 students in the Bay Area and Washington state. 100% of Summit graduates are college ready and Summit graduates complete college at double the national average.

We need exceptional, diverse, and mission-aligned teachers to join our team to help prepare our students for a fulfilled life. Join us!

The Summit Model:

Summit's research-backed model makes teaching and learning at a Summit school unlike any other.

At Summit, our teachers mentor the same group of students each year in advisory groups, which allows them to build strong relationships based on deep trust over multiple years. Mentors meet 1:1 with each student regularly to coach students toward their personal goals, and meet daily as a mentor group.

During Project Time, teachers teach universal skills through real-world projects - using their subject-area expertise to help students apply their knowledge to the world around them. Through our research-backed curriculum, Summit gives teachers the tools they need so that they can focus on teaching and becoming the best project-based teachers in the world.

We are deeply committed to continuous improvement at Summit, both as an organization and for our individual faculty. With dedicated days of professional development built into the academic year, regular coaching sessions with a school leader, and a culture of honest, actionable, and timely feedback, we equip our teachers with the tools necessary to improve their practice and tackle challenging issues. We also prioritize developing leaders from within and have invested in multiple career pathway programs for our teachers and school leaders.

Summit has intensive collaboration structures built in to our weekly schedules. Teachers collaborate at the grade and subject levels, forming regular communities of practice to support each other in continuously improving as project-based teachers and mentors.

By design, our schools are small communities where every student is known. They are intentionally heterogeneous and reflect the diversity of the communities in which we operate. As a teacher, this will require being culturally responsive and creating equitable learning pathways for all students.

What You'll Do:


 * See sample teacher schedules here. A student school day is around 8-8:30am to 3-3:30pm, depending on the specific school. Teachers stay until 5pm three days per week.
 * Project Time: Teach 90-minute blocks in high school or four 55-minute blocks in middle school, per day of project time. Most teachers teach one course for the entire grade (e.g. 9th Grade Biology), and see each section twice per week. Teachers work with students on projects that develop cognitive skills and apply their content knowledge to real-world situations. Teachers facilitate discussions in the classroom, coach students in applying their cognitive skills, and give students feedback. Between teaching blocks, teachers analyze student data, build lesson plans, support school culture, and other personal development activities. Summit teachers build lesson plans through a deep understanding of student progress data, which determines the group and individual supports needed for their students to succeed.
 * Mentor Time: Build deep relationships and sense of community when teachers meet with their small group of mentees daily for their entire time at Summit. Daily, teachers meet with their mentor groups, work on habits of success as a group, and check in one-on-one with their mentees. Mentors coach and advocate for their mentees both inside and outside of the classroom, and strive to support them as they develop their sense of purpose as they become self-directed learners.
 * Self-Directed Learning Time and Interventions: Facilitate Self Directed Learning time and daily literacy or math interventions, which don't involve lesson planning. During this time, teachers provide student support, monitor progress, and check in with individuals or groups of students.
 * Collaboration & Professional Development: Twice a week, teachers participate in all-faculty after-school meetings where community decisions are made, professional development takes place, and faculty collaborates as a grade-level team or subject-level team.
   
   

What You Need:


 * Commitment to uphold Summit's values, and the belief that all children deserve a rigorous and equitable education that prepares them for college and for life.
 * Teaching Credential in Washington or another US state.
 * Bachelor's Degree (a Master's Degree in Education is preferred, but not required).
 * Clear health and background check.
 * Teaching experience in your subject preferred, but not required.
   
   

Who You Are:


 * You want to be a world-class project-based learning teacher.
 * You thrive while collaborating and are excited to work with mission-aligned, high-performing colleagues. You find positivity in shared successes.
 * You're excited to teach Summit's common curriculum and assessment system, which was designed for teachers and by teachers in partnership with learning scientists.
 * You care deeply about working in intentionally heterogeneous schools and are ready to support all diverse students to reach a fulfilled life.
 * You're eager to engage in professional development and be developed as a practitioner in a network that is committed to continuous improvement.
 * You have a growth mindset and see feedback as a positive.
 * You are passionate about serving as a mentor and advocate for a group of students that you'll follow year to year. You're open to having hard conversations to support students.
   
   

What You Get:

In addition to joining a highly motivated team and engaging in meaningful work, you'll have access to a comprehensive suite of benefits including a retirement plan, ""take what you need"" PTO policy, 12 paid holidays, and 3 weeks of organization-wide closures during the year. You and your dependents will have access to multiple health, dental, and vision plans as well as employee life and disability insurance at no cost. Our compensation policy strives to be equitable and transparent. The salary for this position starts at $66,534 and goes up to $96,528 commensurate with experience and qualifications.

Summit is an equal opportunity employer. We believe that diversity, equity, and inclusion are directly intertwined with education. We are ALL better when we are able to bring our whole selves to work and honor each other's voices across identities, cultural backgrounds, and life experiences. We welcome and encourage applications from individuals who are members of historically marginalized communities. Spanish language proficiency is a plus.

Job Description

Mathnasium is a math-only learning center that helps students in grades K-12 catch up, keep up, and get ahead in math. Mathnasium offers math tutoring and enrichment, homework help, and test prep to help students excel in the classroom and beyond.

Mathnasium Instructors teach students in grades K-12 off of their customized learning plan, and assist with homework completion.

What is the difference between a Mathnasium Instructor and a traditional Tutor?

In a traditional tutoring setting, tutors have to teach off of whatever their student brings to them that night (homework, test review, etc). It is the tutors responsibility to plan the best way to help the student. At Mathnasium, all students are a part of an ongoing program and their curriculum is provided by Mathnasium. This removes the stress of scheduling tutoring sessions and planning lessons from the tutor.

All Instructors are provided paid training to acquaint them with Mathnasium curriculum, teaching strategies, and how to team teach.

Requirements:


 * Math proficiency up to Algebra is required. Proficiency through Geometry and Calculus is preferred.
 * Exceptional score on Mathnasium's Math Literacy exam (material from 2nd grade and up).
 * Availability for at least 2 weekday shifts.
 * Clear record on a state and national background check.

Job Description

Mathnasium is a math-only learning center that helps students in grades K-12 catch up, keep up, and get ahead in math. Mathnasium offers math tutoring and enrichment, homework help, and test prep to help students excel in the classroom and beyond.

Mathnasium Instructors teach students in grades K-12 off of their customized learning plan, and assist with homework completion.

What is the difference between a Mathnasium Instructor and a traditional Tutor?

It is the tutors responsibility to plan the best way to help the student. At Mathnasium, all students are a part of an ongoing program and their curriculum is provided by Mathnasium. This removes the stress of scheduling tutoring sessions and planning lessons from the tutor.

All Instructors are provided paid training to acquaint them with Mathnasium curriculum, teaching strategies, and how to team teach.

 * Math proficiency up to Algebra is required. Proficiency through Geometry and Calculus is preferred.
 * Exceptional score on Mathnasium's Math Literacy exam (material from 2nd grade and up).

High School Math Teacher 

 * Are you a passionate and talented teacher? 
 * Do you constantly strive to improve your teaching through coaching, feedback, incorporation of data, and whatever other resources you can find? 
 * Do you seek to be in a diverse and inclusive environment dedicated to equity and anti-racist practices in and outside of the classroom? 
 * Do you want to work in a public charter school that serves almost exclusively students of color and encourages enrollment of students with disabilities and ELL students? 
 * Are you looking for a high school culture that strikes the perfect balance of structure and freedom, where academic rigor drives all aspects of student life, and where constant recognition for hard work and effort is the norm? 

If your answer is YES to all of the above, MESA Charter High School might be the right place for you! 

Math, Engineering, and Science Academy (MESA) Charter High School is a community high school in Bushwick, Brooklyn. We opened our doors in August 2013 and we now have 496 students in grades 9-12. We graduated our first class of seniors in June 2017 and our cumulative graduation rate is 94%. Our students come from more than forty different middle schools, including traditional public, parochial, and charter schools. Some are advanced students coming from magnet schools; others are beginning English Language Learners. What they all have in common is a desire to succeed. MESA students come to school every day, ready to work—we have a 93% attendance rate and a 93% punctuality rate, both significantly higher than other high schools in our district! When it comes to NYS Regents pass rates, MESA outperforms its peers by a rate of 20-30%! 

Some key aspects of MESA’s school model are: 

● Intentional Teaching—MESA uses a standards-based grading system, which makes data understandable and accessible. This enables teachers to create targeted, focused instruction, and helps students understand and track their own progress. MESA teachers love data or at the very least, aren’t afraid of it! 

● Intentional Support—MESA teachers have a minimum of rote administrative duties in order to better focus on planning, instruction, and assessment. Dedicated time for co-teaching, department and grade team planning is built into the school schedule. 

● Intentional PD—MESA has a comprehensive professional development calendar that includes sessions on instructional practices, school culture and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Teachers are also encouraged to seek out PD opportunities outside of the school building. 

● Intentional Culture—MESA’s advisory model connects small groups of entering freshmen with a teacher-advisor for all 4 years of high school. Advisors provide guidance on academic progress and are mentors, facilitators and positive influencers. Students are recognized by their teachers regularly for academic achievement and effort. Students are incentivized to meet school expectations around attendance, punctuality and preparedness. MESA uses the Love and Logic model to address disciplinary concerns. 

● Intentional Relationships—MESA knows that all caregivers want their children to succeed. MESA enlists families as partners in their childrens’ education through regular communication, meetings, workshops, and access to student attendance information and grades. More than 85% of MESA caregivers attend the initial parent-teacher conference of the school year. 

● Intentional Scheduling—MESA’s school day starts later than most DOE schools, as research indicates that a late start helps high-school students succeed. Our Block Schedule allows teachers to delve deeper into content and help develop critical thinking skills. The calendar and earlier start allows for “Intersession,” during Spring Break where students receive enrichment, skill remediation, or Regents preparation. 




















































Specific Responsibilities 

 *  Design and teach five periods of  Math each day (two periods daily of prep time). Utilize Universal Design for Learning method of planning and instruction to reach all learners. 

●   Build relationships with all students. MESA teachers believe that strong rapport is key to student engagement and motivation. 

●  Attend, participate in, and facilitate team meetings and professional development opportunities, as well as common planning times. MESA believes that good professional development is interactive, practical, and teacher-driven. 

●  Communicate regularly with caregivers about both positive and negative interactions with students, making a minimum of two positive contacts (phone, email, or text message) with families per week. 

●  Hold office hours before or after school, at least once per week, to provide extra help and opportunities for reassessment. 

●  Teach one week of Intersession enrichment program based on teacher interest (additional stipend provided). 

●    Maintain duties as Advisor. 

●   Other duties, as assigned by the Principal. 







Qualifications: 

(1) Minimum Bachelor’s degree in subject area to be taught, Master’s Degree preferred; (2) Preferred minimum of three years teaching experience in an urban public or charter school setting, or similar background; (3) Proven track-record of high achievement in the classroom and commitment to accountability; (4) Belief in and alignment with MESA’s core values, educational philosophy and commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion; (5) Valid New York State Certification strongly preferred; (6) Spanish-speaker a plus. 

Salary: $60,000 - $100,000, based on experience.

TEP aims to achieve educational equity for students from traditionally underserved communities by utilizing world-class teachers, while re-imagining the teaching profession as a place in which teachers prioritize their own growth—as pedagogical experts, intellectual seekers, and community leaders.

About the Role (Responsibilities)

As one of the three pillars of our program (Academics, Arts, and Athletics), TEP is deeply committed to building a classroom culture that fosters a genuine love for math and a positive attitude towards learning.

TEP's middle school math department works collaboratively across grade levels to collate, internalize, and differentiate curriculum designed to promote conceptual understanding coupled with standards mastery. TEP's middle school math team has consistently placed in the top 5 in NYC (out of all 373 ranked NYC public middle schools), based on students' long-term growth in math from 5th to 8th grade. We believe that math is not just a tool, but a universal language that affords scholars economic mobility and develops leaders who are eager and equipped to tackle critical 21st century issues. Using data driven expert instruction, pedagogical experimentation, and a deep passion for education, we will develop reflective learners who actively take risks and achieve at the highest level.

As one of The Equity Project's middle school math teachers, you will lead teach students on your grade-level for 90 minutes of math each day, building deep relationships that support student progress and development. Each TEP middle school teacher teaches one subject to one grade level in any given year, but may switch grade levels and/or subjects from one year to the next.

Middle School teachers will work in a state-of-the-art learning environment carefully designed, built, and crafted to spark joy and instill a love of learning for TEP students. Our school building in the Washington Heights/Inwood community, provides a perfect learning environment for developing students by providing innovative classroom settings, a full gymnasium, a high-tech performing arts space, and an indoor/outdoor café where meals are prepared fresh on a daily basis for students and staff.

 * Classroom experience: Minimum of 3 years of lead teaching experience, at least 2 of which must have been in 4th through 9th grade classrooms in a public charter school, traditional public school, or private school setting

 * Certification requirements: Teachers do not need to possess a New York State Teacher Certification to be hired at TEP Charter School. However, prospective teachers that do not yet have New York State teaching certification must identify and present a pathway to obtain New York State teaching certification on their application.
 * Education requirements: TEP adheres to the educational requirements outlined within the individual pathways to NYS teaching certification (see above), and does not require any additional degree programs.

Application Process

TEP is designed and structured around the belief that great teachers are the key to achieving educational success for students. As such, we require applicants to demonstrate their qualifications throughout the application and hiring process. The requirements for each applicant include:


 * Resume: Applicants must submit an up-to-date resume
 * Cover Letter: Applicants must submit a well-written cover letter highlighting their specific interest in joining the TEP community
 * Instructional Video: Applicants must submit an unedited video clip of themselves teaching in a classroom setting or small-group setting
 * Submission of Teaching and Learning: Applicants must submit a portfolio of student work, assessment data for a class of students, or an original curricular tool that they have personally developed
   
   

The requirements for the Instructional Video and the Submission of Teaching and Learning components are specified in detail below.

INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO: Please submit an unedited video clip (maximum 15 minutes) of you teaching in a classroom setting (preferred) or a small-group setting. It is preferred that the students be in the same grade-level as the TEP teaching position for which you are applying, though this is not a strict requirement. The video may contain only one continuous, unedited clip (i.e. do not splice together multiple clips from different points in the lesson). The clip does not need to show an entire lesson; a brief lesson segment is perfectly acceptable.

If you do not have a video with students in the classroom you may still submit a video of yourself teaching. Get creative! You may include a video of you teaching (a) a lesson with/for no students, (b) a lesson of you teaching family members, (c) or a lesson for students virtually. We're excited to see your creativity.

The video must be accompanied by a written narrative that analyzes and reflects upon the teaching and learning that occurs in the lesson and may offer an explanation as to what occurred prior to and subsequent to the clip. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative. The video may be submitted in any format, but a link to a video posted online is preferred.

SUBMISSION OF TEACHING AND LEARNING: Submit one of the following three options:

Option A: Portfolio of Student Work that demonstrates the progress of at least two specific students that you have taught. The portfolio must contain a minimum of two work products for each student (for a minimum of four work products) completed at different points in time during the period when each student was in your class. The portfolio must be accompanied by a written narrative that analyzes and reflects upon the progress that each student demonstrates. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative.

Option B: Assessment Data for at least one entire class of students that you have taught. The assessments may be standardized national, state, or city assessments or your own self-created assessments. The assessment data can be provided in any form that you choose (official documents with students' last names crossed-out, or documents that you create to summarize student assessment performance). The data you provide should ideally show progress over time; as such, it is recommended (though not required) that you provide data for at least two assessments taken at different points in time. The assessment data must be accompanied by a copy of the assessments themselves. If a specific assessment is unavailable, provide a copy of a similar assessment. The assessment data must also be accompanied by a written narrative that provides background on the assessments, explains how the assessments measure student performance, and analyzes the results of your class. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative.

Option C: Original Curricular Tool of any form that you have personally developed. The requirement here is deliberately open-ended because we are interested in seeing anything that you have developed that you believe has meaningfully supported your students' learning. This may take the form of written materials, a unique instructional methodology, a technological innovation, etc. The curricular tool must also be accompanied by a written narrative that provides background on the tool, how the tool functions, and speaks to the impact of the tool within your classroom. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative.","Be among the first 25 applicants","Full-time","Entry level","Education and Training","Technology, Information and Internet",""

EXHIBIT A

STATEMENT OF FAITH

The Statement of Faith is the central statement of Maranatha High School in matters of identity and nature, core beliefs that guide our learning, teaching and living. In faithfulness to God, we joyfully and humbly affirm the following Statement of Faith.

Article #1- THE BIBLE


 * We believe that the Bible was written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit (2 Peter 1:20-21) and that it is without error in the original writings. The Scriptures are profitable for teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness (2 Timothy 3:16-17), that the person may be complete in Christ.
 * We believe that the Bible in its entirety, both Old and New Testament (all 66 books), is true, unchangeable, and authoritative for life and godliness (2 Timothy 3:15-17). It is the complete revelation of God’s will for salvation, sufficient for all that He requires us to believe and do, and final in its authority over every domain of knowledge. Thus the entire Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are without error or misstatement in their moral and spiritual teaching and record of historical facts and people (John 17:17).
 * We believe that the canon (standard) of the Bible is complete and final and that nothing else needs to be added to it (Revelation 22:18-19).
   
   

Article #2- THE TRINITY


 * We believe in the Godhead, the Trinity (Genesis 1:26; Matthew 3:16-17; Matthew 28:19-20) who eternally exists in three persons: God the Father, Christ the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
 * We believe in God the Father who is perfect in holiness, wisdom, power, and love. He eternally exists (Gen. 1:1).
 * We believe in Jesus the Son, who was supernaturally conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit (Matthew 1:18) and born of Mary, a virgin (Isaiah 7:14; Luke 1:27). His mission was to come to earth to die for the sins of humanity in order to redeem us. He later resurrected physically (1 Corinthians 15:12-17), thus confirming His deity and truth claims.
 * We believe in the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity who indwells and seals all believers in Christ. He is a person and possesses all the attributes of God. He is God (Ephesians 1:13-14).
   
   

Article #3- SALVATION


 * We believe that salvation is a gift from God and comes purely by grace through faith in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:8-10).
 * We believe that those who confess and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ will be saved (Romans 10:9-10). This will result in a relationship with God through Christ for eternal life (John 3:16; 10:10).
 * We believe that the message of the Gospel begins with the bad news that all are sinners apart from Christ (Romans 3:10; 3:23; 6:23) and that we all desperately need a Savior who is Jesus (Acts 4:12). We believe the Gospel’s good news is that once we believe in Christ alone we will be his children (John 1:12).
 * We believe that once a person puts their faith in Jesus Christ they will be washed and regenerated by the person of the Holy Spirit and forgiven of their sins (1John 1:9; 1 John 2:2). This will lead, for anyone who has experienced the person of the Holy Spirit, to being sealed in Him, who is given as the pledge of our inheritance with a view to the redemption of God’s own possession to the praise of His glory (Ephesians 1:13-14).
 * We believe that all who reject Christ will suffer eternal separation and suffering in hell in a state of unutterable, endless torment and anguish (2 Thess. 1:5-11).
   
   

Article #4- THE CHURCH and CHRIST'S RETURN


 * We believe that the Church consists of all believers in Christ who are a part, locally and universally, through the baptizing of the Spirit of God (1 Corinthians 12:13). As a result, all believers are a part of the body and bride of Christ.
 * We believe that the person of Jesus will return again bodily and visibly in the unknown future (1 Thessalonians 5:2). This is the glorious and blessed hope of the believer.
   
   

This Statement of Faith does not exhaust the extent of our beliefs. The Bible itself is the sole and final source of all that we believe. For purposes of Maranatha’s faith, doctrine, practice, policy, and discipline, our Head of School and Board of Trustees are Maranatha’s final interpretive authority on the Bible’s meaning and application, consistent with historical, evangelical Protestant interpretation, for the purposes of your relationship with Maranatha.","Be among the first 25 applicants","Full-time","Entry level","Education and Training","Primary and Secondary Education",""

OUR MISSION

Job Description

Mathnasium is a math-only learning center that helps students in grades K-12 catch up, keep up, and get ahead in math. Mathnasium offers math tutoring and enrichment, homework help, and test prep to help students excel in the classroom and beyond.

Mathnasium Instructors teach students in grades K-12 off of their customized learning plan, and assist with homework completion.

What is the difference between a Mathnasium Instructor and a traditional Tutor?

In a traditional tutoring setting, tutors have to teach off of whatever their student brings to them that night (homework, test review, etc). It is the tutors responsibility to plan the best way to help the student. At Mathnasium, all students are a part of an ongoing program and their curriculum is provided by Mathnasium. This removes the stress of scheduling tutoring sessions and planning lessons from the tutor.

All Instructors are provided paid training to acquaint them with Mathnasium curriculum, teaching strategies, and how to team teach.

Requirements:


 * Math proficiency up to Algebra is required. Proficiency through Geometry and Calculus is preferred.
 * Exceptional score on Mathnasium's Math Literacy exam (material from 2nd grade and up).
 * Availability for at least 2 weekday shifts.
 * Clear record on a state and national background check.

As a ""zone"" of schools within the city of Springfield, SEZP's approach draws on a deep and embedded partnership with the school district and local teachers' union, while harnessing the flexibility and innovation found in autonomous school models. As a result, each school within SEZP is accorded significant school-based autonomies - in curriculum, talent, calendar, schedule, and budget - while being held accountable for realizing achievement gains for historically marginalized students. In all of our work, SEZP is in pursuit of equity and anti-racism - acknowledging the systemic oppression our students and families encounter daily and working to disrupt these provision gaps urgently and courageously.

About The Springfield Empowerment Zone Partnership

While Massachusetts is consistently ranked as one of the top states for education results in the country, we have one of the highest and most persistent opportunity gaps. The Springfield Empowerment Zone Partnership (SEZP) - established in 2015 as a collaboration between Springfield Public Schools (SPS), the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE), and the Springfield Education Association (SEA) – seeks to improve the longitudinal life outcomes of the nearly 5,000 students in our seventeen middle and high schools.

As a “zone” of schools within the city of Springfield, SEZP’s approach draws on a deep and embedded partnership with the school district and local teachers’ union, while harnessing the flexibility and innovation found in autonomous school models. As a result, each school within SEZP is accorded significant school-based autonomies - in curriculum, talent, calendar, schedule, and budget – while being held accountable for realizing achievement gains for historically marginalized students. In all of our work, SEZP is in pursuit of equity and anti-racism – acknowledging the systemic oppression our students and families encounter daily and working to disrupt these provision gaps urgently and courageously.

Who We Are

Phoenix Charter Academy aims to show the world what all young people can do, and to defy the limitations of societal assumptions, classism, and racism. Phoenix Charter Academy was founded on the unwavering belief that all students can succeed at high levels. While this mantra is typical of high-performing schools, particularly those in the charter sector, Phoenix truly endeavors to reach every student, focusing on a growing number on the margins of the traditional public district education system: students who have dropped out of high school, students who are parenting children of their own, students who are or have been involved with the juvenile justice system, students who are older and new to the country and cannot gain access to public schooling, and students who are under-credited relative to the number of years they have spent enrolled in high school. We believe that these students, like all students, are completely capable of developing the skills necessary to set themselves up for lifetimes of economic prosperity and success. We support our students with individually tailored and academically rigorous curricula and push them to succeed at the highest levels by providing them with the resources and mentoring that they need to reach their full potential.

Why Our Work is Important

Students across America are dropping out of high school at an alarming rate. Dropping out of high school has a substantial impact on a young person’s life. Over the course of their lifetime, an individual who drops out of high school is more likely to have reduced earning power, greater social service dependency, increased rates of criminal involvement, and shorter life expectancy. Phoenix Charter Academies addresses this trend by creating environments where students can demonstrate their talent and resilience and prepare themselves for success through high school, college, and beyond.

Commitment to DEI

At Phoenix, we recognize the importance of forming a school community inclusive of all visible and invisible identities. We act to ensure that our students and staff always see reflections of themselves and their communities.

At Phoenix, we aim to break down systemic barriers by providing access to resources, experiences, and differentiated supports for historically marginalized groups.

At Phoenix, we solicit, value, understand, connect, and leverage multiple perspectives and experiences. We invite all perspectives except those that perpetuate oppression or dehumanization.

At Phoenix we do not just accept difference - we celebrate it, support it, and thrive on it for the benefit of our scholars and the communities we serve. We believe difference makes us stronger. Phoenix Charter Academy is an equal opportunity employer and as such, we do not discriminate against any team member or candidate because of race, creed, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, national origin, disability, age, veteran status, marital status, pregnancy, or any other basis protected by federal, state or local law. Phoenix Charter Academy is committed to making any reasonable accommodations necessary to support an individual's employment.

Qualities Of Phoenix Staff Member


 * Unwavering belief in our students - Phoenix staff operate with the deeply held belief that all young people want to and can succeed even in the face of substantial systemic barriers and societal constraints.
 * Continuous Improvement - Phoenix staff approach problem solving with curiosity and desire to understand the perspectives of others. They carry an internalized sense of “I can always learn more” and know that adults at Phoenix must model the qualities of being open-minded and willing to make mistakes and learn from them. Phoenix staff members embody “lifelong learner” mindsets and strive for constant improvement.
 * Eager to Learn - Phoenix staff must be able to learn as they go in a fast-paced, ever-evolving, urgent environment. They have the desire to receive direct feedback and the ability to implement the feedback into practice quickly.
 * Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion - Phoenix staff commit to understanding how their self-identity and experiences impact and interact with their daily work, colleagues, and students, and work toward furthering initiatives that promote a more equitable society.
   
   

What You’ll Bring
